  I design, build, and deploy <strong>production-grade AI systems</strong> with a focus on
  <strong>Agentic AI</strong>, <strong>LLM applications</strong>, and
  <strong>enterprise automation</strong>.
   <br>

  My work goes beyond demos — I specialize in creating
  <strong>autonomous, tool-using AI agents</strong> that integrate tightly with real systems
  such as databases, APIs, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms.

  <br>

  I focus on <strong>reliability, scalability, and real business impact</strong> —
  not just model accuracy.
