# Hello, I’m Pankaj 👋

I am a passionate **Data Scientist** with 4+ years of experience specializing in **Generative AI**, **NLP**, and **Deep Learning**. Currently at ITC Infotech, I design and deploy AI-driven solutions that transform unstructured data into actionable insights.

## 🚀 Core Expertise

- **Generative AI & LLMs**: Fine-tuning cutting-edge models (e.g., LLAMA3-8B) using PEFT; building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines for contextual Q&A.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Designing chatbots, semantic search engines, and AI-powered PDF assistants leveraging embeddings (FAISS, Chroma).
- **MLOps & Deployment**: Productionizing ML solutions with **Streamlit**, **Azure AI Foundry Promptflow**, and **MLflow** for scalable, reliable workflows.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Interactive learning experiences and case-study-driven tutors using DQN, PPO in simulated environments.
- **Data Engineering & Analytics**: Python, SQL, pandas, and data visualization to uncover patterns and guide product decisions.
